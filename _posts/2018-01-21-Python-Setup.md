This is the first in the series of posts for the Python Workshop series. 

# Setup Tutorials

1. For windows - Refer the link https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&-pip-Windows-installation

2. For Linux and Mac - Python is pre-installed.

# Testing

1. Once installation is done, open a Terminal on Linux/Mac or a Command Prompt on Windows. 

2. Enter `python` as shown in the below image.

3. You should see the python interpreter ready when you see the `>>>` symbol. As mentioned in the first session, you can now use Python as a calculator (and much more).

4. Hit `Ctrl + D` to stop the interpreter. 


Use the comments section if you are facing any issues while installing.
