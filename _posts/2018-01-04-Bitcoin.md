Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly accepted by the general community. In recent years the value of these currencies have increased multifold. Traditional digital currencies involve a central authority like banks to achieve trust and avoid double spending.

Bitcoin was developed by an anonymous person /group known only by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. This was the first decentralized cryptocurrency to solve the double spending problem. It does so by maintaining a public ledger called the blockchain. The Bitcoin network consists of thousands of nodes distributed across the world which achieves a consensus on every transaction. Everyone in the network maintains a copy of the entire blockchain. Cryptographic techniques are used to ensure trust, although the users don't trust anyone else. Privacy is achieved by enforcing anonymity using public key cryptography. We will now look at blockchain and bitcoin in detail and explore the way in which its goal of decentralization is achieved.

## Blockchain

Blockchain is a data type consisting of a ledger. The Blockchain ledger is a linear list of blocks. Each block consists of a list of verified transactions. Each new transaction shows previous verified transactions as proof of funds. The verification and the proof of funds are all ensured using cryptography based on the Discrete log problem. The ledger is updated in a distributed fashion. All the nodes in the network maintain the entire blockchain.

The main goal of the ledger is to preserve the truth and ensure that it is consistent across the network using special protocols. Each user in the network has a private key which is essential to claim the bitcoins received by her over time. If the private key is known to an adversary, all the money is lost. Similarly, if the private key is lost, all the money is lost from the system forever. Each user also has a public key, which is derived from the private key using a one way function. This serves as an address to which money can be sent to that user.

## Block

A Block consists of a list of transactions and is typically restricted to 4MB of size. Each block also consists of a header which contains metadata such as a timestamp and the size of the block. Furthermore it also stores the hash value of the previous block. The hash is typically calculated by applying the SHA256 hash function, which is a cryptographic function, twice. These hashes forms a crucial part of the protocol that prevents double spending.

The above figure describes the structure of each transaction log in blockchain.

## Transactions

Each transaction consists of two parts: The addresses of the destinations along with the amounts to be sent to each of them and proof for the source for these funds. This way every transaction refers to an already verified source transaction. Digital signatures are used to ensure that the intended recipients are able to use the sent bitcoins in future. More specifically suppose that A sends n bitcoins to B, along with B’s address and the number of bitcoins sent, A signs the transaction using her private key and also includes a cryptographic puzzle, which can only be solved if B’s private key is known. This ensures that only B can claim this transaction in the future. Hash values the transactions are also included, which ensures that any malicious change to the block changes the hashes of the entire chain. This ensures correctness and consistency of the blockchain.

## Transaction Example

We explain this section using a simple example. Consider the following transaction: Alice(A) sends 3 bitcoins to Bob(B) using funds of 5 bitcoins which Alice in turn received from Carol(C).


**Tasks to be done by Alice -**

* Find Address of Bob
* Create a transaction log
* Show proofs of funds
* Send the request into the network

Typically the public key of Bob is used as the address. Other methods include using special hashes of the public key. The following are the various fields that constitute the transaction.

**Hash value for the transaction:** The current log's hash value as computed by the SHA256 function

**Sign:** Digital signature of Alice using the transaction as the message and her private key. The signature can be verified by anyone in the network using the public key of Alice.

**Locking script:** Alice writes a locking script into the transaction which can be unlocked only by the intended recipient Bob. This forms the basis for Bob's claim on these funds.

**Proof for funds:** Alice should show the proof of how she got the 5$. This is shown by the hash value of the proof of funds transaction and the unlocking script for the locking script of that proof of funds transaction. This way, each transaction links backwards to the previously verified transaction forming a chain that goes all the way back to the very first transaction made on the Bitcoin. This is called the Genesis block. The chain of transactions is illustrated in Figure.

## Consistency

Note that the chain of the transactions extends upto the genesis block for any given transaction, wherein each transaction in the chain contains the hash value of the previous transaction. Thus if any change is made in any of the transaction, the hash values of the all the blocks starting from that transaction change drastically (this is ensured by the SHA256 hash). Thus any malicious change to the blockchain by any of the nodes is easily found out. This is illustrated in the figure below.

## Double Spending

With the design presented till now, there is another key problem of double spending is still present. Consider the following transaction: Alice buys a book from Bob (A to B) using n bitcoins. Before the transaction is updated on all the nodes in the bitcoin network, Alice uses the same n bitcoins to buy coffee from Carol (A to C). Some of the nodes in the network receive A to B request before A to C, and other nodes receive them vice versa. This creates an inconstancy in the network.

The consistency of the network is maintained by a leader-follower consensus protocol using special nodes in the network called miners. Any node can choose to become a miner node. At the end of each transaction block (typically 4MB of transactions), a cryptographic puzzle is assigned to each miner. The miner that solves the puzzle first is elected the leader and all the nodes follow the leader's version of the block. This solves the double spending problem. If two miners solve the problem at the same time, a fork is created in the blockchain, which gets resolves in the next block. The protocol ensures that a new block takes roughly 10 minutes to be added to the blockchain.

## Incentive for miners

After every block is created, new bitcoins are created in the network, which can be claimed by the miner that first solves the cryptographic puzzle. This provides an incentive for the miners to create blocks. These generated bitcoins are added to the block as a special transaction with the address of the miner who first solves the puzzle as the recipient address.  Furthermore, a small transaction fee can also be collected by the miner for each transaction.
